# Test dataset

This test data is only for technical software check of the pipeline during
development and not as a test of scientific validity.

Data were subsetted from an [example
dataset](http://learnmetabarcoding.github.io/LearnMetabarcoding/data/sectionA.zip)
in the [Bioinformatic Methods for Biodiversity Metabarcoding
tutorial](https://learnmetabarcoding.github.io/) by Creedy, Vogler, and
Penlington, which is released under a [CC-BY-SA-4.0
license](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/deed.en), and were
originally published by [Creedy, Ng, and Vogler,
2019](https://doi.org/10.1002/ece3.4839).

The test database was subsetted from the public data package of the [Barcode of
Life Data System v4](https://www.boldsystems.org/) database, which is released
under a [CC-BY-SA-4.0
license](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/deed.en). The example
HMM was built from translated sequences from BOLD.
