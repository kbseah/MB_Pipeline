This test data is only for technical software check of the pipeline during
development and not as a test of scientific validity.

Data were subsetted from an [example
dataset](http://learnmetabarcoding.github.io/LearnMetabarcoding/data/sectionA.zip)
in the [Bioinformatic Methods for Biodiversity Metabarcoding tutorial]() by
Creedy, Vogler, and Penlington, and were originally published 
by [Creedy, Ng, and Vogler, 2019](https://doi.org/10.1002/ece3.4839).

The test database was subsetted from the [Barcode of Life Data System
v4](https://www.boldsystems.org/) database; the example HMM was built from
translated sequences from BOLD.
